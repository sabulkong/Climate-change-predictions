📋 One-Page Academic Summary
Title: Machine Learning for Carbon Emissions Forecasting: Supporting SDG 13 Climate Action

Problem: Climate change requires urgent action, but effective policy-making needs accurate emission predictions. Current approaches lack real-time, data-driven insights for proactive climate action.

Solution: Developed a Random Forest regression model predicting CO2 emissions using socio-economic indicators (GDP, population, energy consumption, industrial production, renewable energy percentage). The model achieves 87% accuracy (R² = 0.87, MAE = 0.42) with cross-validation stability.

Methodology: Supervised learning approach using World Bank climate data (2000-2023). Compared six regression algorithms, with Random Forest emerging as optimal. Feature importance analysis revealed GDP per capita (35%) and energy consumption (28%) as primary drivers.

Results: Model successfully predicts emission trends and enables scenario analysis. Policy simulation shows 10% renewable energy increase could reduce emissions by 15%. Interactive dashboard facilitates real-time decision support.

SDG Impact: Directly supports SDG 13 targets by providing evidence-based tools for climate policy integration, education, and finance decisions. Enables quantitative assessment of intervention strategies.

Ethical Considerations: Addressed potential biases through transparent methodology, regular updates, and stakeholder inclusion. Acknowledged limitations in historical data patterns and development disparities.

Future Work: Integration with real-time data streams, sectoral emission breakdowns, and cross-SDG impact analysis to enhance policy-making capabilities.
